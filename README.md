# LowRAMTwitchViewer
I wanted to develop a Windows 10 app to view Twitch. I would use the Twitch Windows App, but it uses a Chrome extension.  
It would use up a lot of memory when running. I tried using other web browsers, but still would use a lot of memory. Hopefully,
with this implementation would lessen the memory usage.

I pulled the twitch-embed javascript from twitch to view errors and use as is.
